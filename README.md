# Myanmar Travel Route Optimization System

## Overview

This project explores the application of **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to identify optimal travel routes across major cities in Myanmar. The system models cities as nodes and roads as weighted edges to compute the shortest and most efficient paths between destinations. It supports travel planning, transportation analysis, and educational purposes by demonstrating how graph algorithms can be applied to real-world transportation systems.

## Project Scope

- Covers approximately **77 major cities in Myanmar**
- Includes primary road connections between cities
- Represents the transportation network as a **weighted graph**
- Distances are measured in **miles**

## Key Features

- Implements **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** for route optimization
- Supports user-customizable itineraries:
  - Start city
  - Destination city
  - Optional city to avoid
- Visualizes optimal routes using a plotted graph
- Displays distance (in miles) for each road segment
- Calculates and shows the total travel distance

## Objectives

- To implement Dijkstra’s Algorithm to provide **real-time route solutions** for travelers and transportation systems
- To preserve and promote Myanmar’s transportation network
- To demonstrate the real-world usefulness of Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- To reduce time consumption and manpower by automating route planning

## Benefits

- Improves travel planning for tourists and local travelers
- Assists transportation authorities in evaluating route efficiency
- Acts as an educational tool for understanding graph algorithms
- Enables faster and more accurate decision-making compared to manual route selection

## Algorithm Used

- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
  - Computes the shortest path between cities in a weighted graph
  - Works with non-negative edge weights
  - Widely used in navigation and transportation systems

## Visualization

- Graph plot of cities and roads
- Optimal travel route highlighted
- Individual edge distances shown in miles
- Total route distance calculated and displayed

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how a classical algorithm such as **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** can be effectively applied to a real-world transportation system. By modeling Myanmar’s road network, the system contributes to smarter travel planning, increased efficiency, and better utilization of transportation resources.
